# drawMolecule
A tiny tool to draw molecule from a Gauss .log file. 

This is now wrote for C_60, but I removed the uploaded log file. To draw something different, it must be modified.

And pls forget about my poor makefile.

See [LearnOpenGLCN](https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/), my knowledge came from here, as well as the Shader class code.
